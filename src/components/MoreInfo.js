            <p>
                I am a fourth-year Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary, passionate about building impactful, 
                user-centered applications that turn ideas into seamless digital experiences. With expertise in both front-end and 
                back-end technologies, I specialize in creating efficient, scalable solutions that prioritize usability and functionality. 
                My technical skills include JavaScript (React.js & Node.js), CSS/HTML, Python, Java, SQL, and C/C++, enabling me to tackle 
                challenges across the full software stack. I thrive on solving complex problems, collaborating with others, and leveraging 
                technology to make a meaningful impact. Explore my work and see it in action!
